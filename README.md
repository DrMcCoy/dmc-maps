DrMcCoy's Maps
==============

This is a repository of maps I've drawn for my Pathfinder games, for use
in [Foundry VTT](https://foundryvtt.com/).

All maps are licensed under the terms of the [Creative Commons
Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International
license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/) (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0).
However, since I make use of several asset packs created by others, their
terms also apply. See below.

You can find [dmc-maps here on GitHub](https://github.com/DrMcCoy/dmc-maps).


Tools used
----------

These are the tools, programs and assets I use.

- [Dungeondraft](https://dungeondraft.net/)
- [Dungeon Alchemist](https://www.dungeonalchemist.com/)
- [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/)


Assets used
-----------

All maps created using [Dungeon Alchemist](https://www.dungeonalchemist.com/)
are made using their assets, so are technical derivative works of their work.
They don't have full licensing terms available on their website, but during
their Kickstarter campaign, they clarified that non-commercial usage is
unrestricted and that [even commercial usage of the maps, up to a point, is
a given](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1024146278/dungeon-alchemisttm/posts/3123255).
Since I release these maps under a non-commercial Creative Commons license,
this *should* mean that using these maps otherwise should be no problem.

But: I am not a lawyer and this is not legal advice.

All maps I create using [Dungeondraft](https://dungeondraft.net/) are made
with the [Forgotten Adventures](https://forgotten-adventures.net/) asset packs.
Detailed license information can be found [here on their Patreon FAQ master
post](https://www.patreon.com/posts/fa-master-post-44664619). Since I release
these maps "for free" and under a non-commercial Creative Commons license, they
would be considered "Fan-Content License".

But again: I am not a lawyer and this is not legal advice.

Other asset packs I use:

Design notes
------------

General design notes about these maps:

- No grid lines
- Unless otherwise noted, the maps use a resolution of 150 pixels per square
- If a location contains several levels, I often arrange all levels in a grid
  into a single image
- I generally don't add doors in the map images. Instead, I add them later
  in [Foundry VTT](https://foundryvtt.com/), so I can do dynamic things like
  hidding the door image when it's open
- I don't necessarily add all objects found in the rooms directly into the
  map images. When it's an object that is likely to be interacted with,
  destroyed, etc. by the players, I'll add them later directly in [Foundry
  VTT](https://foundryvtt.com/).
